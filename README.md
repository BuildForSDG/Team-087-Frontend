## About

<!-- What is this project about. Ok to enrich here or the section above it with an image.

Once this repo has been setup on Codacy by the TTL, replace the above badge with the actual one from the Codacy dashboard, and add the code coverage badge as well. This is mandatory -->

This project is about the frontend screens (UI/UX) that power the effort at creating a platform to assist **`mental-health patients`** in accessing proper care by providing relevant recommendations on **`mental-health specialists`** around them as well as **`care-groups`** for better closure.
<br><br>

## Why

<!-- Talk about what problem this solves, what SDG(s) and SGD targets it addresses and why these are important -->

In the midst of a pandemic such as we have around the world today with the **`COVID-19`** outbreak, many people would have been set into depression. As a result, mental-health issues are likely to become the order of the day post-pandemic. It is important that the right care is accessible to prospective patients of different age-demographic amidst other preferences/factors. So, this project aims to address the **`Problem 1`** of **`Goal-3`** of the **`SDGs`** by building a platform where relevant recommendations can be made and proper care can be accessed within the vicinity or closest locality of the prospective mental-health patient.
<br><br>

## Usage

<!-- How would someone use what you have built, include URLs to the deployed app, service e.t.c when you have it setup -->

This frontend project can be accessed via <https://mental-lyf.herokuapp.com> or <https://mental-ly.netlify.app>.
<br><br>

## Setup

Run `yarn install` .<br><br>

### Hints

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Contributing

If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to <buildforsdg@andela.com> to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :

1.  area one (e.g this app is about `mental-health patients` and the `specialists`/service-providers in this health-sector and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)

2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at <https://mental-lyf.herokuapp.com> and report any bugs via a form)

3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
